# Motion Tracking
This repository contains [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) demonstrations of the following algorithms related to motion tracking:
- Mean shift
- [Continuously adaptive mean shift (CAMSHIFT)](http://opencv.jp/opencv-1.0.0_org/docs/papers/camshift.pdf)
- Iterative [Lucas-Kanade algorithm](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~stb/klt/lucas_bruce_d_1981_1.pdf) with pyramids *(for sparse optical flow)*
- [Farneb√§ck's algorithm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45103-X_50) *(for dense optical flow)*

This is part of a course output in a computer vision class for master's students under Dr. Joel P. Ilao of the Department of Computer Technology, De La Salle University.
